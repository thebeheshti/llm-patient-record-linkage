# Patient Record Linkage Using Language Models

This repo contains all the training and inference code for every model evaluated in *"Leveraging Open-Weight Language Models for Automated Patient Record Linkage"* (Beheshti et al., submitted to *BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making*).

The record linkage pipeline has two independent stages, evaluated separately (see the Methods section of the paper): **blocking** (Experiment 1) and **matching** (Experiment 2). This repository contains the codes for both.

## Data availability

The underlying patient data contains Protected Health Information (PHI) and is **not included** in this repository, per the manuscript's Data Availability declaration. 

## Blocking model (Experiment 1)

Corresponds to Figure 1 in the paper.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `RoBERTa_Embedding_Finetunning.ipynb` | Fine-tunes RoBERTa as a sentence-embedding model (`sentence-transformers`, mean pooling, cosine similarity loss against the Overall Similarity Score); see Figure 1(a). |
| `RoBERTa_Embedding_Finetuned_Inference.py` | `CandidatePairGenerator` class: encodes both datasets with the fine-tuned embedding model, builds a FAISS index, and retrieves candidate pairs via k-NN search filtered by a cosine similarity threshold. |

## Matching model (Experiment 2)

### RoBERTa classifier (encoder-based baseline)

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `RoBERTa_Classification_Finetuning.ipynb` | Fine-tunes RoBERTa as a binary sequence classifier (Match / Non-Match) on serialized record pairs. |
| `RoBERTa_Classification_Finetuned_Inference.ipynb` | Runs the fine-tuned classifier on the test set and reports accuracy / classification report. |


### Generative LLMs

Fine-tuning and inference code for each open-weight generative LLM evaluated in the study:

| Model | Fine-Tuning | Fine-Tuned Inference | Zero-Shot Inference |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Llama-3.2-3B | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Llama-3.1-8B | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mistral-7B | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mistral-Small-24B | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Gemma-3-27B | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Llama-3.3-70B | — | — | ✓ |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B | — | — | ✓ |

Llama-3.3-70B and DeepSeek-R1 were evaluated zero-shot only (no fine-tuning), per the paper's Methods and Table 3.

DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B's notebook differs structurally from the others, since it is a reasoning model that emits a chain-of-thought trace (wrapped in `<think>...</think>`) before its final answer:
- Evaluated only on the challenging subset of the test set (0.65 < Overall Similarity Score < 1.0), not the full test set, per §3.3 of the paper.
- Uses a much larger generation budget (`max_new_tokens=2048` vs. 4 for every other model) and a correspondingly larger `max_seq_length`, to allow the reasoning trace to complete.
- Answer extraction searches only the text *after* `</think>` for "Yes"/"No", rather than the whole decoded output, to avoid picking up an incidental mention of either word from within the reasoning trace itself.
- Uses its own prompt format (`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>...<｜Assistant｜>`) rather than a chat template, since no Unsloth-registered chat template exists for this model. The same pre-formatted prompt from the `instructions` column is placed in the user turn of this wrapper (between `<｜User｜>` and `<｜Assistant｜>`).

### Prompt template

Every generative LLM in this study received exactly the same prompt, shown below (also Figure 2 in the paper). To avoid any risk of the template changing across models, the prompt is **not** built on the fly inside each notebook. Instead, every record pair was pre-formatted into this template once, ahead of time, and saved in the `instructions` column of the input data. All fine-tuning and inference notebooks read this column directly and place its content, unchanged, in the **user** role of each model's chat template. The only model-specific step is therefore the chat template itself, which wraps the same user message in each model's own role tokens.

```text
You are given two patient records. Your task is to determine whether they belong to the same individual.
Consider factors such as name similarity, date of birth, and other identifying attributes.
Only respond with "Yes" or "No".

Record 1:
- First Name: [Record 1 First Name]
- Middle Name: [Record 1 Middle Name]
- Last Name: [Record 1 Last Name]
- Date of Birth: [Record 1 Date of Birth]
- SSN: [Record 1 SSN]
- Sex: [Record 1 Sex]
- Address: [Record 1 Address]

Record 2:
- First Name: [Record 2 First Name]
- Middle Name: [Record 2 Middle Name]
- Last Name: [Record 2 Last Name]
- Date of Birth: [Record 2 Date of Birth]
- SSN: [Record 2 SSN]
- Sex: [Record 2 Sex]
- Address: [Record 2 Address]
```

Notes:
- Missing identifiers (e.g., SSN or Address) are filled in with the word `Unknown`.
- During fine-tuning, the ground-truth label (`Yes` or `No`) is supplied as the assistant's response; at inference, the model generates it.
